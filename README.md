## Game Description

Battleship is a 2 player game inspired by the classic board game and quantum computing. Users are responsible for strategically placing their caterpillars in their respective environments so that they are least likely to get squished by their opponent. Users can also entangle some of their caterpillars with ones on their enemies’ board in an attempt to sabotage their enemies’ game. The first player to squish all the opponent’s caterpillars wins!
